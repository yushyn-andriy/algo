2) Humans:
Humans have developed a number of traits which enable them to survive as a
group much better than they would do without these traits. The most important
****END_OF_TEXT****
one in my view is language, i.e. the ability to communicate in abstract terms.
****END_OF_TEXT****
This enabled Homo Sapiens to build increasingly sophisticated societies with
****END_OF_TEXT****
ever-increasing technological achievements which in turn made them populate
****END_OF_TEXT****
basically the entire world (it's surface, at least) in the last 50.000 to
****END_OF_TEXT****
100.000 years on the expense of other Homo species and lot's of non-Homo
species as well. To achieve this, a high level of cooperation is needed with
individual members often showing altruistic behaviour not only in supporting
their next of kin but also strangers, i.e. society as a whole. This works
even when some individuals clearly act in selfish ways as long as they are
****END_OF_TEXT****
in a relatively small minority. So in evolutionary terms Homo Sapiens had
some very successful tens of thousands of years lately. Of course, the moral
implications of making a lot of other species getting distinct in the process
are an altogether different thing which evolution doesn't stress itself with.
