"""
Builder is a creational design pattern, which allows constructing complex objects step by step.

Usage examples: The Builder pattern is a well-known pattern in Python world. Itâ€™s especially useful when you need to create an object with lots of possible configuration options.

Identification: The Builder pattern can be recognized in a class, which has a single creation method and several methods to configure the resulting object. 
Builder methods often support chaining (for example, someBuilder.setValueA(1).setValueB(2).create()).

        Concrete Builders are supposed to provide their own methods for
        retrieving results. That's because various types of builders may create
        entirely different products that don't follow the same interface.
        Therefore, such methods cannot be declared in the base Builder interface
        (at least in a statically typed programming language).

        Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder
        instance is expected to be ready to start producing another product.
        That's why it's a usual practice to call the reset method at the end of
        the `getProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not mandatory,
        and you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset call from the
        client code before disposing of the previous result.
